# Dental Tycoon - Game Design Document

## Concept
A dental practice management simulation game. Build and run a dental practice from the ground up or acquire an existing one. Roller Coaster Tycoon meets Oregon Trail — you set up the systems and watch it run, dealing with consequences of good and bad decisions.

## Two Starting Paths

### Path 1: Start from Scratch
- Huge bank loan ($500K-$1M)
- Zero patients, zero reputation
- Pick everything: location, equipment, staff
- Slow build, full control
- High debt, low income at first

### Path 2: Acquire an Existing Practice
- Big loan to purchase
- Comes with existing patients, staff, equipment, reputation
- Could be a great deal or a money pit (bad staff, old equipment, bad reviews)
- Different price points: small vs large practice
- More income from day one but inherit problems

## Core Mechanics
- **Build/Expand**: Add operatories, equipment, waiting areas
- **Hire Staff**: Dentists, hygienists, front desk, assistants
- **Equipment**: Chairs, x-rays, sterilizers, tools — upgradeable
- **Revenue**: Flows based on setup — more chairs = more patients = more money
- **Overhead**: Salaries, equipment, rent, supplies eat into profit
- **Reputation**: Online reviews, patient satisfaction, marketing

## Staff System
- Each staff member has ratings: skill, attitude, reliability
- Good staff = happy patients = good reviews = growth
- Bad staff = complaints, mistakes, patients leave
- Hire, fire, train, give raises
- Overpay = burning cash, underpay = they quit

## Risk/Reward
- Bad decisions hurt: overhiring, bad equipment, ignoring reviews
- Good decisions compound: reputation grows, patients refer others
- Random events: equipment breaks, staff quits, insurance issues

## Monetization
- Free to play — organic progression
- Optional tokens/coins (real money) to speed up progress
- Skip wait times, unlock equipment faster

## Tech
- Web app (browser-based) to start
- Can convert to mobile app later
